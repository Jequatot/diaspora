			Artificers push against the boundaries of magical research
by merging science and magic into something new. Most
artificers begin their careers as magicians or engineers, though
anyone with a penchant for making mechanical wonders
might pursue this path. Artificers learn to use their magic to
piece together bits of gear to create useful devices, from armor
to weapons, bombs to simple tools. Eventually, they can imbue
spells in these devices to create even more powerful gear.

		<h3>LEVEL 3 ARTIFICER</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Attributes</b> Increase two by 1<br/>
			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +2, Power +1<br/>
			<b>Languages and Professions</b> Add one Academic Profession and one Common or Artisan Profession.<br/>
			<b>Magic</b> You discover a tradition or learn one spell.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Artificer's Bag</b> You have a bag filled with spare parts you use to create equipment. You measure the number of parts in silver pieces, though the parts are worthless to anyone other than you or another artificer. The sp value of these spare parts is equal to twice your group level.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can use an action to begin assembling parts from your bag into a suit of armor, a weapon, ammunition, or an engineering item by spending parts from the bag with a value equal to the item’s price. It takes 1 minute to create the object, during which time you must concentrate and use a tool kit. At the end of this time, you have a finished piece of equipment that remains until you complete a rest, at which point it collapses into spare parts once more. When you complete a rest, you replenish the parts in your Artificer’s Bag, up to your normal maximum value in sp. If you lose your Artificer’s Bag, you can create a replacement. It costs a number of sp equal to your level. You can have only one Artificer’s Bag at a time.
		</p>
		<h3>LEVEL 6 ARTIFICER</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +2<br/>
			<b>Magic</b> You discover a tradition or learn one spell.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Store Spell</b> You can use an action to touch one object you created from your Artificer’s Bag. If you concentrate for 1 minute, during which time you must maintain contact with the target, you can expend the casting of a spell and imbue the casting of that spell into the object. The casting remains in the object until you complete a rest or until it is expended. Any creature holding the object can use an action to expend the casting from the object and cast the spell, regardless of the creature’s Power. 
		</p>
		<h3>LEVEL 9 MASTER ARTIFICER</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +2, Power +1<br/>
			<b>Magic</b> You discover a tradition or learn one spell.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Mechanical Servants</b> You can use an action to create one or more small constructs using materials contained in your Artificer’s Bag. For each 1 sp in materials you spend, a <b>compelled small construct</b> <span class='span_subtitle'>(See below)</span> appears in an open space within short range of you. You can grant the flier trait to any number of constructs by spending 1 extra sp from the bag for each construct you would make fly. If you target one of these constructs with Store Spell, you can use an action to command the construct from medium range to cast the spell. The constructs remain until destroyed or until you complete a rest. At the end of this time, the mechanical servants collapse into parts.
