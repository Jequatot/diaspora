		<h1>SAPPER</h1>
		<p>
			Doors, grates, and walls prove to be no obstacle to a welltrained sapper. These experienced engineers study the manufacture and practical use of explosives. As skilled as sappers are in producing and using bombs, they are also accomplished trap makers. A sapperâ€™s traps, when triggered, are loud and deadly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite advanced training, sappers tend to be jumpy and fatalistic. Handling volatile materials makes sappers cautious in nearly every endeavor. Most sappers expect an abrupt, fiery death to be their end.

			<b>Bomb Maker</b> You know how to create bombs, and you tinker with your creations while you rest. Each time you complete a rest, you create 1d3 blinders, 1d3 crackers, and 1d3 smokers. They retain potency until you complete your next rest.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can use an action to light the fuse on one of these bombs and throw it to a point within medium range. At the end of the round, the bomb has its effect, as follows:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Blinder:</b> The bomb releases a flash of blinding light in a radius of 1d6 yards. Sighted creatures in the area must get a success on a Strength challenge roll or become blinded for 1 round.</li>
			<li><b>Cracker:</b> The bomb explodes in a radius of 2d6 yards. Everything in the area takes 3d6 damage. A success on an Agility challenge roll halves the damage.</li>
			<li><b>Smoker:</b> The bomb spews smoke of a color you choose. The smoke spreads out to fill a sphere with a radius of 2d6 yards. The first half of the radius is heavily obscured, while the rest is partially obscured. The smoke persists for 1d6 rounds or until dispersed by wind.
		</ul>
